# IBM project with Python
Welcome to my GitHub project!

This repository showcases my work from the Python course offered by **IBM's professional certification**. The project revolves around **querying Tesla's stock data** using various techniques, such as **Web Scraping**. I utilized popular Python libraries, including **pandas, yfinance, and requests**, to perform data analysis and processing.

Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and results. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Thank you for checking out my project, and I hope it serves as a valuable resource for fellow Python enthusiasts and learners! ðŸ˜¸
